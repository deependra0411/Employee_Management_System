This project is an Employee Management System (EMS) implemented using Python and MySQL.It follows a class-based structure to manage interactions with the database,including creating databases,tables,and performing CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations on employee records.

Key Features:

Class-Based Structure: The system utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to organize code,enhancing modularity and maintainability.

MySQL Connector Library: Integration with the MySQL connector library facilitates a secure and efficient connection to the MySQL database.

Database Creation: The system can create databases,providing a structured environment to store employee records.

Table Creation: An employee table is created within the database,defining columns such as ID,name,post,and salary.

CRUD Operations: The system supports CRUD operations on employee records:

Create: New employee records can be added,including checks for duplicate IDs.
Read: Employee data can be retrieved and displayed.
Update: Employees can be promoted to new positions with salary adjustments.
Delete: Employee records can be removed from the database.
